### Hold Great Meetings

* Your reputation for getting things done in meetings, of not wasting time, of gathering information, of facilitating strong group decisions, will carry over into your other activities and encounters with people.
* One of the first thing you can do when you start a meeting is to set a positive and productive tone. Your own demeanor and attitude are likely to be reflected by the people attending.
* Make sure you're pleasant and friendly even if today's agenda includes some difficult topics. Elon Musk has said that he leads by example, he brings his A-game to meetings, setting the standard for everyone to follow.
* You should already know what the goals of the meeting are. And you should've already sent the agenda and any reading material to the participants, expect them to come prepared. And be ready to hold them accountable in a firm but friendly way for the information you have distributed.
* In continuing to keep the tone of the meeting productive, make sure that everyone understands how each topic, each discussion and each decision fits into the big picture. For example, a decision may seem small, it may apply to a local team process but it's your job as a leader to connect that small decision to the overall goals of the organization and the needs of the business.

### Yes, and...

* Let's look at an example. Speaker one says, I think we can streamline our process if we combine our first two reviews into one and put it at the midpoint. Speaker two says no, that won't work. But I think we need that early review to help work out the bugs.
* (Yes, and..) Speaker 1 says, I think we can streamline our process if we combine our first two reviews into one and put it at the midpoint. Speaker 2 says, yes, and we can put the extra time and effort into better planning up front so we have fewer bugs.

### Make Sure Everyone Gets Heard

* Be aware of your role as a leader.
* Your demeanor and your attitude can contribute to a positive atmosphere.
* Next, create some ground rules for how to handle hot spots, such as disagreements, controversial topics, aggressive interruptions and dominating speakers.

### The key rule: communicate Early and Often

What if you don't have all the facts?

* prepare a holding statement
* establish regular media updates
* communicate company values
* avoid wating and "no comments"
* tell then what you'll do

Holding statemenet:

* this is what we know
* this is what we care about
* we are investigating
* we will update you in an hour

living our value everyday:

* We care about the pepole involved
* We are committed to the full disclosure

> And I think it's critical to point out today that if I don't understand what you are saying, I don't trust you. And if what you are saying is so technical and beyond my ability to understand, I'm not going to invest the time to figure it out. I just don't trust you. I don't like you. I don't believe you. So companies that take the time to help people understand how to make communication inclusive so that people can instantly understand what you are saying, I think is the secret here.
