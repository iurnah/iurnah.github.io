### Hold Great Meetings

* Your reputation for getting things done in meetings, of not wasting time, of gathering information, of facilitating strong group decisions, will carry over into your other activities and encounters with people.
* One of the first thing you can do when you start a meeting is to set a positive and productive tone. Your own demeanor and attitude are likely to be reflected by the people attending.
* Make sure you're pleasant and friendly even if today's agenda includes some difficult topics. Elon Musk has said that he leads by example, he brings his A-game to meetings, setting the standard for everyone to follow.
* You should already know what the goals of the meeting are. And you should've already sent the agenda and any reading material to the participants, expect them to come prepared. And be ready to hold them accountable in a firm but friendly way for the information you have distributed.
* In continuing to keep the tone of the meeting productive, make sure that everyone understands how each topic, each discussion and each decision fits into the big picture. For example, a decision may seem small, it may apply to a local team process but it's your job as a leader to connect that small decision to the overall goals of the organization and the needs of the business.

* (Yes, and..) Speaker 1 says, I think we can streamline our process if we combine our first two reviews into one and put it at the midpoint. Speaker 2 says, yes, and we can put the extra time and effort into better planning up front so we have fewer bugs.

### Make Sure Everyone Gets Heard

* Your demeanor and your attitude can contribute to a positive atmosphere.
* Next, create some ground rules for how to handle hot spots, such as disagreements, controversial topics, aggressive interruptions and dominating speakers.
